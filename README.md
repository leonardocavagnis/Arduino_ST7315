# 🖥️ Arduino ST7315 Library

This library allows you to control ST7315-based OLED displays using an Arduino board.

The ST7315 is a single-chip CMOS OLED/PLED driver and controller designed for dot-matrix graphic displays.
It communicates over the Wire (I²C) interface and integrates display RAM, an internal oscillator, and voltage generation circuitry, making it ideal for embedded user interfaces, wearable devices, and compact information displays.

## 🖌️ Graphics API
This library is built on top of the Arduino Graphics library and uses its APIs to draw content on the screen.
